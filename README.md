# degree-programs-scraper

A scraper tool that scrapes from [https://www.umbc.edu/degrees/](https://www.umbc.edu/degrees/) in order to create an up-to-date machine-readable representation of all the degrees/certificates that UMBC offers.

This project is the enable other developers to tap into this data however they see fit. This program ensures that people don't have to manually go to the various department websites to see what minors they offer, etc. The UMBC Degrees site may not be 100% up-to-date at all times, but it is managed by the university, so I don't imagine that it will ever drift too far from the truth.
